# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease is a major life-threatening disease that can cause either death or a serious long-term disability since its diagnosis in most cases depends upon a complex combination of clinical and pathological data.
The main objective of this study is to build a model that can predict the occurrence of Heart
Disease by processing a patient's dataset with the help of Machine Learning Algorithms.In this research, we will try to use more extra and different input attributes to predict the accuracy of the model.Different machine learning classification techniques will be implemented and compared upon standard performance metrics such as accuracy.
